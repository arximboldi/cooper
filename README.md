Jolly Python Basic Library http://www.sinusoid.es/jpblib/

This is a Python library providing reusable basic components that extend
the standard library, like generic and Pythonic instantiations of design 
patterns, configuration or argument management and metaprogramming utilities.

Basically this is a bag for tools develoepd in different projects.  Some of 
them might be extracted into sepparate libraries.
